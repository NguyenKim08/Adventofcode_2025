Hello, my name is Nguyen Kim Ngan and this year I will be attempting to do Advent of code :'D
Whether or not I can do it, it'll be just a fun challenge for me :3 (even though I'm already late but whatever, we can just ignore that part for now)
But, first... Merry Christmas to you all !!
(Big note : I'm doing this as I'm learning, so if it's messy I've tried my best)
